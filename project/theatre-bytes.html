                            <p>America is about 6 months deep into a locked-down and shut-in state of COVID-19. Streets
                                are empty, schools are closed, and small businesses and organizations are suffering.
                                While a few have adjusted and have found ways to operate virtually, the Kelly Strayhorn
                                Theater (KST) has found it challenging to deliver performing arts to their audience and
                                even worse, to raise money for operations and staff. Without revenue, how can this
                                Pittsburgh-local non-profit continue to create and deliver innovative performances to
                                their audience? How can they continue to be a space for new and upcoming, local artists

                    <h5>Generative + Evaluative Research</h5>
                    <p>We began our project with background research about the Kelly Strayhorn Theater (KST) in
                        Pittsburgh, PA, as well as the area of performing arts. We received data from KST regarding
                        sources of funding, attendee retention rates, and first-hand executive experience from KST
                        Executive Director, Joseph Hall (2020).</p>
                    <p>Our research methods included:</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>Contextual Interviews</li>
                        <li>Affinity diagramming</li>
                        <li>Storyboarding</li>
                        <li>Speed Dating</li>

                        <li>Experience Prototyping</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Questions from Research</h5>
                    <p>The results from our preliminary research identified opportunity areas. Joseph Hall emphasized
                        KST’s need for utilizing technology and their physical theater space for creative ways to engage
                        their audience in this increasingly virtual world. From the data sources we analyzed, it was
                        also clear KST could benefit from diverse pools of funding, as a majority of their funds were
                        from one-time donations and city-wide grants.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <p>The data gave us an idea of the current state of the Kelly Strayhorn Theater. To move forward in
                        our research pursuits, we identified a few questions as research goals intended to guide our
                        process:</p>

                    <h5>Takeaways from Research</h5>
                    <p>We gathered a few key takeaways from our background research that lead us to our first round of
                        user-interviews! I conducted Usability-Tests using the 3LD website, to learn about viewers’
                        experiences surrounding donations towards performing arts organizations.</p>
                    <p>We chose to test the 3-Legged Dog website because like KST, it was also a performing arts
                        company. 3LD stood out to us because they used technology to create immersive, digital theater
                        experiences for their audience. I conducted 1 of the 4 usability test sessions using the
                        Think-Aloud method.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h5>Think-Aloud Insights</h5>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong> 01. Unclear Donation Information</strong></p>
                    <p>Users had particular issues with finding the donation link, as well as understanding where their
                        money was going towards or where 3LD needed extra funding. Some users wanted to donate to
                        specific productions or artists, but were unable to do so.</p>
                    <p>Proposed Solution: We propose presenting the Donation link prominently as a tab or button that
                        can be accessed from anywhere on the website and include options to donate on social media as
                        well. In addition, we also propose tailoring messages to potential donors’ specific concerns. Be
                        clear about what the company is asking for and where/how the money is going to be used. Also
                        provide a clear path for people to donate directly to artists.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong> 02. Information Overload</strong></p>
                    <p>When specifically looking for information regarding productions, users struggled with an
                        abundance of visual stimulation on the production page. Reels moved too quickly, and there was
                        no accompanying text or description to inform users. Users were unfamiliar with the technology
                        that 3LD uses, so images were not always helpful.</p>
                    <p>Proposed Solution: Decrease the amount of moving images throughout the 3LD website and offer more
                        text descriptions or information for each performance. Use moving images, videos, or gifs when
                        highlighting a particular production a user wants to learn more about. Potentially provide more
                        education surrounding the media and technology that 3LD uses in their theater spaces.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong> 03. Engagement Challenges</strong></p>
                    <p>Users did not find what they expected when attempting to engage with 3LD outside of productions
                        and events. The 3LD company website either offered limited engagement opportunities or an
                        unclear presentation of contact information.</p>
                    <p>Proposed Solution: Our solution should include aspects of engagement a user would expect to see
                        in a clear format. Rather than adding essential content below-the-fold, if we choose to redesign
                        a contact page for KST, we should include all the necessary information in the visible space of
                        the viewer. We should also include all types and opportunities for engagement in this space.</p>

                    <h5>Refined Research Question</h5>
                    <p><em>How might we better understand people&#x27;s experiences donating to performing arts and the
                            factors around making donations in a theater context?</em></p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h4>UX Research</h4>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>In our research, we conducted 8 generative and evaluative methods in order to understand people’s
                        attitudes and perceptions of donations. We conducted over 12 interviews to dive deep into what
                        barriers people face and what potential solutions feel the most compelling.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                    <p>We hypothesized that attending unconventional theater experiences of KST would increase funding
                        by creating experiences that reach people and therefore provide increased value and relevance to
                        their lives. This, we believe, would translate to attendees being more willing to donate to KST.
                    </p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <h5>Interview Goals</h5>
                    <p>Our objective for user interviews was to gain a better understanding of people’s experiences
                        donating within a theater/performing arts context. I was interested in learning about the
                        motivational factors behind making donations, how much people understood the details of where
                        their money was going, and their perceptions about recurring donations.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <h5>Who Did I Interview?</h5>
                    <p>I interviewed participants who represented various backgrounds, cultures, ages, genders, and
                        experiences. These individuals had experiences donating. I was looking for people who had
                        previously donated once, or multiple times, to performing arts organizations and/or non-profits.
                    </p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <h5>How did I Interview?</h5>
                    <p>I conducted contextual inquiries with directed storytelling and artifact analysis, think-aloud
                        sessions, semi-structured interviews, and speed dating sessions with participants. For the
                        contextual inquiry, I attempted to simulate a donation context by asking participants to prepare
                        one or more artifact(s) from a donation they have made, or a performing arts event they
                        attended.</p>
                    <p>Our findings led us to define the theme of our project and eventual solution: <strong>Donations
                            as Engagement.</strong></p>
                    <p>Donors to performing arts wished they had greater capacity to monetarily support such
                        organizations. They also expressed appreciation for more streamlined processes where convenience
                        is prioritized.</p>

                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>From our interview data, we found common themes relating to fiscal considerations made before
                        donations take place, ease and comfort of potential donors, motivating factors of making
                        donations, and personal engagement with companies. Through this process, we were able to more
                        fully understand people’s experiences donating to performing arts.</p>
                    <p>Our discovered themes and affinity diagramming led us to insights that revealed how people think
                        about the donation-making process: people perceive donations as engagement. A main motivating
                        factor for donating to a performing arts organization is the personal connection with the
                        creative community or the organization. </p>
                    <p>‍</p>

                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>Yet, beyond appreciating the performing arts, financial ability is critical for determining
                        whether people can follow through with a donation, as well as how much they can donate. When
                        going through the donation process, individuals prioritize ease, convenience, and transparency.
                        If these needs are met, people generally trust the organization to handle their donations
                        appropriately.</p>

                    <p>There are a few motivating factors when it comes to making donations:</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>Personal financial state must be considered first before making any donations.</li>
                        <li>Donation process should be simple, integrated, and easy to follow.</li>
                        <li>Emotional connections to the community is an important motivating factor for
                            donation-making.</li>
                        <li>Trust &amp; transparency are important in the donation process.</li>
                        <li>Having a personal and known direct impact of donation was more important than material
                            benefits.</li>

                        and personal investment. We wanted to create an accessible and transparent digital platform
                        tailored to the local community. We hoped this would serve as an avenue to building more engaged
                        communities where people feel invested in the work and progress of local artists.</p>

                    <p><strong> 01. Adding it up</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> People resonated with the idea of small donations making a larger
                        impact.</p>
                    <p><strong>Validation:</strong> All participants except for one, enrolled in the Theatre Bytes Round
                        Up Program. Participants enjoyed being able to contribute “micropayments” but see the larger
                        impact. This option felt like less of a financial burden and an easier way to make donations to
                        support the theatre.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong> 02. Mobile First</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Participants really engaged with text message updates for their
                        donations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Validation:</strong> The text message updates seemed to be a part of the prototype that
                        really engaged participants. Specifically, updates made participants feel a part of the theatre
                        community, and also created transparency/trust for where their money was going.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong> 03. Communication is key</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Because the round-up program is a newer donation concept, we should
                        focus on better communication on the idea / details.</p>
                    <p><strong>Validation:</strong> While people liked the donation program concept as a whole, they
                        also considered the idea itself rather new in the space of donations. Because of a lack of
                        previous experience, participants felt like there could be clearer messaging for the overall
                        program, as well as more information about the settings (how to un-enroll, how to choose which
                        updates to receive, consenting to text messages, etc.).</p>

                    <p><strong> 04. Simple is Best</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Participants prioritize a seamless and efficient donation process</p>
                    <p><strong>Validation:</strong> Participants found the single-page format and one-click payment
                        effective for making donations. Some suggested stronger labeling of donations in order to
                        quickly communicate what money is used for without needing to read the smaller text or
                        descriptions.</p>

                    <p>From the insights, we were able to determine where the experience could be improved to help
                        facilitate their needs. We made changes to the language, added graphics, created a more compact
                        layout, and added clearer confirmation.</p>

                            stakeholders. Our idea provided a streamlined and transparent donation process that
                            resonated well with users and that required minimal effort to set up (by way of product
                            subscription) from KST.</div>

                            virtual performances. Reimagining the way performing arts is consumed would work to the
